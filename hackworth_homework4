	Program assignment 4 tracks the days of training

	This program tracks how many days it takes the runner to run 3 milesin under 20 minutes. 

	Scope:
	  User enter 3 mile time
	    The program calculates the number of days it took the user to run under 20 minutes
		If it takes more than one try, it will repeat again

	History:
	 Inital Release						Mia Hackworth 3-14-2021
		Added switch statement			Mia Hackworth 3-16-2021
		Added float race5kTime			Mia Hackworth 3-16-2021

Test Plan:
	Test Alorgithm:
	1: Set breaking points at case 3: race5kTime = race5kTime + indiviaulMile;
	2. Enter numbers 20 and less

	Expected results:
	1. Vaules over 20 will go onto the switche statements and loop
	2. Values 20 and less will give back 0 days of training
